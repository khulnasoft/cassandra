/**
 * Represents a related group of concrete SAI components files which are either all the per-sstable components of a
 * given sstable, or all the components of a particular column index (for a given sstable).
 * <p>
 * The members of a component group correspond to actual SAI component files on disk, and are components that are
 * written together. A group is identified by:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>the sstable it is the components of (identified by the sstable {@link #descriptor()})</li>
 *     <li>the index ({@link #context()}) for the components, which is {@code null} for the per-sstable components</li>
 *     <li>the version the components are using. All the components of a group are on the same version</li>
 *     <li>the generation, within the version, of the group/components. Generations are used when
 *     {@link CassandraRelevantProperties#IMMUTABLE_SAI_COMPONENTS} is used, to avoid new builds to override (and thus
 *     mutate) older builds. When the option of immutable components is not used, then the generation is fixed to 0.
 *     See below for more details.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 *
 * <h2>Immutable components</h2>
 *
 * As mentioned above, when {@link CassandraRelevantProperties#IMMUTABLE_SAI_COMPONENTS} is enabled, existing components
 * are not overwritten by new builds (the underlying intent is to allow rebuilding without stopping reads (to the
 * rebuilt indexes). But unless a rebuild uses a different version than the existing components, the new components
 * need "something" to distinguish them from the old ones, and it is what the generation provides.
 * <p>
 * The generation is specific to a component group, meaning that all the components of a group share the same
 * generation (or to put it another way, if 2 components only differ by their generation, then they belong to different
 * build and thus different groups), but that different groups can have different generations. For instance, if a
 * specific index is rebuilt but without rebuilding the per-sstable components of each sstable, then after that rebuild
 * the per-sstable groups will have generation 0, but the index groups will have generation 1.
 * <p>
 * When a sstable is "loaded", the "active" set of components to use is based on finding, for each kind of groups
 * (per-sstable and per-index), the "complete" (see next paragraph) set of components with the highest version, and
 * highest generation within that version.
 * <p>
 * A group of components may or may not be "complete" ({@link #isComplete()}): it is complete if the completion marker
 * component for that group is present. Groups are temporarily incomplete during writing, but can also be more
 * permanently incomplete for 2 main reasons: a build may fail mid-way, leaving one or more group incomplete, or we can
 * have some corruption of the component files of some sort (corruption could here mean that a file is mistakenly
 * deleted, or that the content of the file is corrupted somehow; the later triggers a removal of the corrupted file and
 * of the completion marker, but not of the other component of the group). The bumping of generations takes incomplete
 * groups into account, and so incomplete groups are not overridden either. Essentially, the generation used by a new
 * build is always one more than the highest generation of any component found on disk (for the group in question, and
 * the version we writting, usually {@link Version#latest()}).
